    six_dof_ecef_quaternion_fixed_mass(state, mass, inertia, forces, moments;
    k=0.0, ellipsoid=WGS84)

Six degrees of freedom dynamic system using quaternions for attitude 
representation and assuming fixed mass. 

Ellipsoidal Earth Model is used and the ECEF reference frame is considered
inertial.

It is considered that the aircraft xb-zb plane is a plane of symmetry so that
Jxy and Jyz cross-product of inertia are zero and will not be taken into 
account.

# Arguments
- `state::12-element Array{Number,1}`: state vector.
    u, v, w: inertial linear velocity expressed in body axis. (m/s)
    p, q, r: inertial rotatinal velocity expressed in body axis. (rad/s)
    q0, q1, q2, q3: attitude given by quaternions.
    xe, ye, ze: position wrt the inertial system origin expressed in Earth Axis. (m)
- `mass::Number`: total mass of the aircraft (kg)
- `inertia::3×3 Array{Number,2}`: inertia tensor (kg·m²)
- `forces::3-element Array{Number,1}`: total forces expressed in body axis. (N)
- `moments::3-element Array{Number,1}`: total moments expressed in body axis.(N·m)
- `k::Number`: orthonormality error factor.
- `ellipsoid::Ellipsoid`: ellipsoid model to be used. 

# Returns
- `state_dot`: state vector derivative according to the equation of motion,
    inertial properties and applied forces and moments.

# Notes
- See [1] (page 41, formula 1.4-23) or [2] (page 372, formulas 10-11 to 10-14)
  for more information on quaternions <-> Euler angles conversions.
- Orthonormality error factor is related to a numerical stability artifact used
  in angular kinematic equations. Let λ = k * (1 - q0² - q1² - q2² - q3²) be
  the orthonormality error. The term k·λ·q is added to the angular kinematic
  equations in order to reduce the numerical integration error. According to
  reference [2] k·Δt ≤ 1. See [2] (page 372) for more information on 
  orthonormality error factor.
- Implementation based on [1]. However, [2] can also be read.
